### Hi there 👏👏

👋 Hello World! I'm [Mandefro Endalk], a full-stack developer from Ethiopia with a love for building innovative web applications and solving real-world problems. My journey in the world of coding began with a dream to create my own digital solutions, and now I'm turning that dream into reality one line of code at a time.

💻 As a full-stack developer, I enjoy working with a variety of technologies including JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, Node.js, and more. I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools and frameworks to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

🚀 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the vibrant tech community, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a cup of coffee while brainstorming my next big idea. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
 Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me for any inquiries or collaboration opportunities.
🌟 <h3>Let's connect and build something awesome together!    Happy coding! 😊<h3/>

 <summary><h2>👨‍💻 Coding Journey</h2></summary>
 I started my coding journey with a passion to learn everything I could about the programming world when I was in grade 12. I taught myself web development with the dream of building my own website and app, but soon, that dream was overshadowed by my desire to excel in JavaScript. This desire led me to a full-stack software engineering job. However, something has always bothered me about my journey – abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route of a job.

Now, I've taken the leap away from that safety net into the uncomfortable, unexplored world of being a creator, and it worked out. But again, it became comfortable. Of course, I need to eat at the end of the day, but I think it's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse and fulfill that dream the younger me had of building my own app, my own product.

In order to do that, I'll be implementing a few measures to focus more time on fulfilling that dream – a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2024 due to the measures I'm putting in place now until the beginning of 2023. Don't wait up because I'm coming."
